# text-image-deblur

This repository contains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model specifically trained to deblur images of text. It is designed to evaluate and compare its performance against the general-purpose image deblurring model, DeblurGAN

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/slymachenko/text-image-deblur.git
    cd text-image-deblur
    ```

2. Install Dependencies:  
    Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can use conda enviornment provided in `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    conda create --name text-image-deblur --file requirements.txt
    conda activate text-image-deblur
    ```

3. Run the Model:  
    Use the provided Jupyter Notebook main.ipynb to train or evaluate the model.
